          service made on this website is void. We don't guarantee that the
          quality of any items, services, information, or other material you buy

          prior notice (including after you have submitted your order). Except
          as required by law, we make no commitment to update, change, or
          clarify information in the Service or on any connected app/website,
          including, without limitation, price information. The absence of a
          defined update or refresh date in the Service or on the website should
          not be interpreted as indicating that all information in the Service
          or on the website has been modified or updated. <br />
          <br />
          <b>SECTION 11 - INDEMNIFICATION</b>

          <br></br>If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be
          unauthorised, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced
          to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the
          unenforceable portion shall be deemed severed from these Terms of
          Service; however, such determination shall have no bearing on the
          validity and applicability of the remaining provisions. <br />
          <br />
          <b>SECTION 13 - TERMINATION </b>
          <br></br>For all considerations, the parties' commitments and
          liabilities accrued prior to the termination date will survive the
          termination of this agreement. Unless and until either you or us
          terminate these Terms of Service, they will remain in effect. You may

          termination; and/or accordingly deny you access to our Services (or
          any part thereof). <br />
          <br />
          <b>SECTION 14 - AGREEMENT BRIEF </b>
          <br></br>We will not be deemed to have forfeited any right or
          provision of these Terms of Service if we fail to exert or enforce
          such right or provision. These Terms of Service, together with any
          policies or operating rules posted by us on this website or in
          relation to The Service, represent the entire agreement and

          <br />
          <b>SECTION 18 - PRIVACY POLICY </b>

          <br />
          We collect personal information such as your name and contact number
          when you register yourself on our app/website as part of the
          purchasing and selling process. We automatically obtain your

          new subjects introduced, and other updates, with your permission.
          <br />
          <br /> When you give us personal information to complete a
          transaction, verify your credit card, or place an order, we imply that
          you agree to us collecting and using it for that specific purpose
          alone. If we require your personal information for a secondary

          Service, we may disclose your personal information. <br />
          <br />
          For payment processing, we use Razorpay. Your card information is not
          stored on our or Razorpay's systems. When processing payments, the
          data is encrypted using the Payment Card Industry Data Security

          transaction information is not saved once that is done. Our payment

          practises to ensure that your personal information is not
          inappropriately misplaced, misused, accessed, disclosed, manipulated,

          <br />
          <b>SECTION 19 - CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</b> <br></br>All the content
          users post/represent/make use of on this website/through our services
          :<br></br>
          <br></br>
          Guideline 1 : No Vulgarity: We prohibit the public display of nudity
          or sexual activities. We also remove sexual imagery by default to
          avoid the distribution of non-consensual or underage content.
          Digitally made content is similarly subject to restrictions on the
          display of sexual activities. We also prohibit sexually explicit
          language that could lead to solicitation since some members of our
          student community are sensitive to this type of content and it could
          make it difficult for them to connect with their peers and the larger
          community. <br></br>
          <br></br>Guideline 2 : No Violence: We eliminate content that
          encourages violence or celebrates other people's suffering or
          humiliation because it may discourage participation. We allow (with
          some restrictions) graphic content to help individuals raise awareness
          about concerns. We recognise how vital it is for people to be able to
          talk about serious subjects like human rights violations or terrorism.
          We also know that various people have different levels of sensitivity
          to graphic and violent content. <br></br>
          <br></br>Guideline 3 : No Bullying: Bullying and harassment take
          numerous forms, ranging from threats to the release of personally
          identifying information, to sending threatening texts and initiating
          unwelcome malevolent contact, to making nasty comments. This type of
          behaviour is not tolerated on LearnBowl because it makes people feel
          unsafe and unwelcome. We take down content that is intended to
          humiliate or disgrace people. We know that bullying and harassment can
          have a greater emotional impact on pupils, which is why our policies
          give our users more protection. People are encouraged to report such
          inappropriate conduct and content. <br></br>
          <br></br>Guideline 4 : No Hate Speech: We don't allow hate speech on
          LearnBowl because it fosters a climate of fear and exclusion, and in
          some situations, it can lead to real-world violence. Hate speech is
          defined as a direct attack on persons based on their protected
          qualities, which include race, ethnicity, national origin, religious
          affiliation, sexual orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity,
          and significant disease or disability. We characterise assault as
          violent or degrading rhetoric, declarations of inferiority, or calls
          for exclusion or segregation, and we respond accordingly. Please
          revisit our privacy policy periodically as we retain the right to
          change it at any moment. Changes and clarifications will go into
          effect as soon as they are posted on the website. We will notify you
          here if we make major changes to this policy, so you are aware of what
          information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances,
          if any, we use and/or disclose it. Your information may be transferred
          to the new owners if our app/website is sold or merged with another
          firm so that we can continue to sell things to you. <br></br>
